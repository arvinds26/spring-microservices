Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are
1. Highly maintainable and testable
2. Loosely coupled
3. Independently deployable
4. Organized around business capabilities
5. Owned by a small team

The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
